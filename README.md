# Omer Ceder's Overwolf Test Project

## Notes for the exercise hand off

### AI / LLM

I've been using [cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/), which is a beefed up VS code with LLM support (such as gpt-4o, claude) as an autocomplete tool and for tips and prompted questions.

It assisted me with syntax and to write the scripts file.

This allowed me to easily create a 'running numbers' script without the use of an external library, for example.

It's important to note that I did not rely on it for anything else and 
**that I am completley acccountable for every line of code and can explain it and why it's written there**. 

This exercise is not the result of heavy prompting and no chat bots were abused to complete it! :)

### CSS 

* I've used regular CSS and not SCSS/SASS. In retrospect, I think it would have been better to use SCSS and compile it even for a one-pager like this.
* I did try to make use of the variables as much as possible.

### Responsiveness

I tried to have the page as fully responsive as possible, and it should look OK in all resolutions (not just desktop/mobile).

### Other / MISC

* I've added some things to add some 'bling', for example - the 'tool boxes' in the tools section pop up when scrolled into view.
Also some hover transitions and other small stuff
* The swiper was a little tricky because of the right side overflow, I hope I got it right.
* The mobile specs pdf (dev-test-mobile.pdf) was corrupted and couldn't be opened, I hope I didn't miss anything there.
* Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions about my proccess.
